I am a researcher-on-train working with Prof. Weitian Chen in The Department of Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I joined the research group from 2020 as an research assistant and transferred to a PhD student in 2021. My research focus on application of deep learning in MRI and the detailed topics includes deep learning-based reconstruction, quantification, and diagnostics with 3D and quantitative MRI.

Before that, my early career began at The Department of Computer Science and Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, BNU-HKBU United International College. I got my Bachelor of Science degree there in 2018, and worked as an assistant instructor there from 2018 to 2019. I later got my Master of Science degree in 2020 at The Department of Information Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
